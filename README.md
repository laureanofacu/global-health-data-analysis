# Global Infectious Disease Mortality Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores global mortality trends caused by major infectious diseases over time.  
The main objective is to compare regional patterns and identify long-term trends using historical public health data.

## Dataset
- **Description:** Annual number of deaths by cause, country, and year  
- **Time range:** 2000–2020  
- **Granularity:** Country-level data aggregated by region  
- **Variables:** Multiple causes of death related to infectious and non-infectious diseases

## Methodology
The analysis followed these steps:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Mapping countries to global regions
- Aggregation of deaths by region and year
- Min–Max normalization to compare trends across diseases
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using line charts

## Focused Diseases
The analysis focuses on five major infectious diseases:
- Tuberculosis  
- HIV/AIDS  
- Malaria  
- Lower respiratory infections  
- Diarrheal diseases  

These causes were selected due to their global relevance and distinct regional patterns.

## Key Visualizations
- Temporal evolution of infectious disease mortality by region  
- Comparison of major infectious causes within each region over time  

## Main Insights
- Infectious disease mortality shows strong regional disparities
- HIV/AIDS and lower respiratory infections remain dominant in several regions
- HIV/AIDS presents a clear rise followed by stabilization after the early 2000s
- Despite global improvements, some regions still face a significant infectious disease burden

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Next Steps
Future work could include population-adjusted mortality rates, deeper outlier analysis, and predictive modeling.
